Interrupt logic and concept

comments
In Arduino programming, interrupts provide a mechanism for the microcontroller to respond immediately to specific events without delay. Interrupts are particularly useful for handling time-sensitive tasks, such as sensor readings, button presses, or external signals, while allowing the main program to continue executing other tasks.

What is an Interrupt?
An interrupt is a signal that temporarily halts the microcontroller's current operation to handle a specific event. When an interrupt occurs, the microcontroller jumps to a predefined function called an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), executes the code within the ISR, and then returns to the main program.

How Interrupts Work in Arduino
The main program executes normally.
An external event (like a button press) occurs.
The microcontroller pauses the main program and jumps to the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
The ISR handles the event, such as turning on an LED or raising an alarm.
Once the ISR completes, the program resumes from where it left off.
Types of Interrupts in Arduino:
1. Hardware Interrupt: Triggered by an external event such as a button press, sensor signal, or hardware input change. It is used to monitor critical real-time events.

For example, when an I/O operation is completed such as reading some data into the computer from a tape drive.

An interrupt generated by a mouse when a button is clicked
An interrupt generated by a network card when data is received
An interrupt generated by a disk drive when a read or write operation is completed
How Hardware Interrupts Work in Arduino:

Arduino UNO provides two hardware interrupt pins:
Pin 2 (Interrupt 0)
Pin 3 (Interrupt 1)
More advanced boards like Arduino Mega have six hardware interrupts.
2. Software Interrupt: Software Interrupt is invoked by the use of INT instruction. This event immediately stops execution of the program and passes execution over to the INT handler. The INT handler is usually a part of the operating system and determines the action to be taken. It occurs when an application program terminates or requests certain services from the operating system. Triggered inside the program using code. Mainly used for tasks like timers and exceptions.

For example, output to the screen, execute file etc.

A system call to read or write data to a file
A division by zero exception
A page fault exception
Using Interrupts in Arduino
Arduino provides the function attachInterrupt() to define and use interrupts.

Attach Interrupt:
Use the attachInterrupt() function to assign an interrupt to a specific pin.

Syntax:
attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(pin), ISR, mode)
Parameters:

pin: The digital pin number where the interrupt will be attached(Pin 2 or 3 on Arduino UNO).

ISR: The function (Interrupt Service Routine) to execute when the interrupt is triggered.

mode: The mode in which the interrupt should be triggered (e.g., LOW, CHANGE, RISING, FALLING).

RISING → When the signal goes from LOW to HIGH.
FALLING → When the signal goes from HIGH to LOW.
CHANGE → On both rising and falling edges.
LOW → When the pin remains LOW.
Define Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):

Create a function to handle the interrupt.
This function should be declared with the void return type and take no arguments.
Inside the ISR, write the code to respond to the specific event that triggered the interrupt.

--> Temperature Sensor TMP36
**Required Components
    Arduino UNO
    Breadboard
    Resistors
    LEDs (x3)
    TMP36 Temperature Sensor

Circuit Diagram Explanation:
TMP36 Connections:
    V_out (Pin 2) connects to A0 (analog input pin) on the Arduino.
    V_in (Pin 1) connects to 5V on the Arduino.
    GND (Pin 3) connects to GND on the Arduino.
    LED Connections:
    The anode of each LED connects to digital pins 2, 3, and 4 on the Arduino.
    The cathode of each LED connects to a resistor, which then connects to GND on the Arduino.

Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)/Photoresistor Sensor

  LDR Terminals:
    Two Terminals: An LDR has two terminals, which are non-polarized, meaning you can connect them in either direction.
    Required Components
    Arduino UNO
    LED
    LDR
    Resistor (10kΩ)
    Breadboard

Connections:
LDR Connection:
Connect one terminal of the LDR to the 5V supply on the Arduino.
Connect the other terminal of the LDR to the A0 analog input pin on the Arduino.
Connect a 10kΩ resistor between the LDR terminal (that goes to A0) and GND.
LED Connection:
Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED to the digital pin 9 on the Arduino.
Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to GND on the Arduino through a 220Ω resistor.

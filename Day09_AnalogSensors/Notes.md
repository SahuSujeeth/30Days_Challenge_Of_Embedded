## Temperature Sensor Interfacing with Arduino


## Temperature Sensor TMP36 :-
The TMP36 is a low voltage, precision centigrade temperature sensor that provides a voltage output proportional to the temperature. It is suitable for various applications and can be easily interfaced with Arduino to measure temperature and trigger different actions, such as glowing LEDs based on the temperature variation.
## TMP36 Sensor Pins:
V_in: Connects to the 5V power supply from the Arduino.
V_out: Provides an analog voltage output that varies linearly with temperature.
GND: Connects to the ground of the Arduino.

## Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)/Photoresistor Sensor
An LDR, or Light Dependent Resistor, is a sensor that changes its resistance based on the amount of light falling on it. When the light intensity increases, the resistance decreases, and when the light intensity decreases, the resistance increases. This property makes it useful in applications such as light meters, alarms, and automatic lighting systems.

## LDR Terminals:
Two Terminals: An LDR has two terminals, which are non-polarized, meaning you can connect them in either direction.

## Force/Pressure Sensor
A force or pressure sensor is a device that measures the amount of force or pressure applied to its surface. These sensors can be used in various applications, such as robotics, industrial automation, and consumer electronics. They typically have a resistive material that changes resistance based on the applied force.

Sensitive Areas
Active Area: The main part of the sensor where the force is applied and measured.
Resistive Element: The material within the sensor that changes resistance based on the applied force.
Connector Leads: The terminals that connect the sensor to an external circuit or microcontroller.
Protective Layer: A layer that protects the sensitive elements of the sensor from physical damage or environmental factors.

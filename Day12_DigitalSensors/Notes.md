## Interfacing PIR Sensor with Arduino

A Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor detects motion by measuring the infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. When a warm body (like a human or animal) passes in front of the sensor, it detects the change in IR levels, triggering an output signal.

## Gas Sensor
A Gas Sensor detects the presence of gases in an area and is often used as part of a safety system. This project will interface a Gas Sensor to an Arduino and activate a buzzer and a green LED when the gas concentration is high.

## Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
An Ultrasonic Distance Sensor is a device that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. It emits an ultrasonic wave and measures the time it takes for the echo to return. This time is then converted into a distance.

## IR Sensor
An Infrared (IR) sensor is a device that detects infrared radiation, typically emitted by objects as a function of their heat. These sensors are commonly used in various applications like obstacle detection, proximity sensing, and remote controls.
